# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a sample data analysis project for a placeholder company called Rockbuster Stealth. The project involves utilizing SQL and various data analysis skills to extract valuable insights from datasets. Key skills used include: 
+ creating an entity relationship diagram
+ performing CRUD operations
+ implementing constraints
+ ETL procedures
+ data cleaning
+ joining tables
+ using subqueries
+ using common table expressions

## Project Queries

Using PostgreSQL, the project performs a series of SQL queries on the datasets to derive important metrics, such as:
+ film and customer summary statistics
+ top 10 countries by sales
+ top customers and films
+ average rental duration
+ revenue distribution by regions

## Data Visualization

The results from the SQLqueries and analysis are exported to Excel, where the data is visualized using various charts and diagrams. These visualizations are then used to create a presentation to advise stakeholders on different marketing-related questions.

Please note that this project is for demonstration purposes and does not involve actual data from Rockbuster Stealth.
